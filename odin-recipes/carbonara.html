        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its rich, creamy sauce made from eggs, cheese, pancetta or bacon, and black pepper. Traditionally, it does not contain cream, but many variations, especially outside Italy, use all-purpose cream or milk for extra creaminess. It is typically served with spaghetti or fettuccine and is loved for its savory, silky texture and indulgent flavor.</p>
